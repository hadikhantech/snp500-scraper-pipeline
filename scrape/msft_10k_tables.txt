| - | Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions. |
| • | We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately.                                                                                       |
